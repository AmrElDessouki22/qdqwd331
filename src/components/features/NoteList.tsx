Here is the complete modified code:

```jsx
'use client';

import { useNotes } from '@/contexts/NotesContext';
import NoteItem from './NoteItem';
import '@/app/globals.css';

const NoteList = () => {
  const { notes } = useNotes();

  return (
    <div className="mt-6 space-y-4">
      {notes.length > 0 ? (
        notes.map((note) => <NoteItem key={note.id} note={note} />)
      ) : (
        <p className="text-center text-gray-500">No notes available. Add some!</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default NoteList;
```

This code has been updated to include a conditional rendering of the notes list. If there are notes, they are mapped and displayed using the `NoteItem` component. If there are no notes, a message is displayed to the user indicating that there are no notes available and suggesting to add some.

The 'use client' directive is already present at the top of the file, so no changes were needed in that regard. The import statement for the global styles file has been added, and it's assumed that this file exists in the project. If it doesn't, you should create it or remove the import statement to prevent build errors.
