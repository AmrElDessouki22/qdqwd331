Here is the modified code:

```javascript
// 'use client' directive is not needed here as this is not a React component file
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'primary': '#0d6efd',
        'secondary': '#6c757d',
        'success': '#198754',
        'danger': '#dc3545',
        'warning': '#ffc107',
        'info': '#0dcaf0',
        'light': '#f8f9fa',
        'dark': '#212529',
      },
      fontFamily: {
        'sans': ['Graphik', 'sans-serif'],
        'serif': ['Merriweather', 'serif'],
      },
      spacing: {
        '1': '8px',
        '2': '12px',
        '3': '16px',
        '4': '24px',
        '5': '32px',
        '6': '48px',
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      opacity: ['disabled'],
      backgroundColor: ['active'],
      textColor: ['active'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    require('@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio'),
  ],
};
```

Please note that the 'use client' directive is not needed in this file as it is not a React component file. It is a configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The 'use client' directive is used in React components that use hooks or event handlers to ensure they run only on the client side, not on the server side.

Also, ensure that the plugins specified in the 'plugins' array are installed in your project. If they are not, you need to install them using npm or yarn. If they are not installed and you try to require them, it will break the build.
